## PanPhlAn - strain detection and characterization

#### Pangenome-based Phylogenomic Analysis

PanPhlAn is a strain-level metagenomic profiling tool
for identifying the gene composition and *in-vivo* transcriptional activity of individual strains
in metagenomic samples. PanPhlAnâ€™s ability for strain-tracking and functional analysis of unknown
pathogens makes it an efficient tool for culture-free infectious outbreak epidemiology and
microbial population studies.

PanPhlAn is written in Python and covers the three main tasks:

* `panphlan_pangenome_generation.py`, to create the pangenome database of a bacterial species

* `panphlan_map.py`, to profile each metagenomic sample by mapping it against the species specific database  
  [read more](https://github.com/SegataLab/panphlan/wiki/PanPhlAn-mapping)
* `panphlan_profile.py`, to merge and process the mapping results for getting the final gene presence/absence and transcriptional matrices

PanPhlAn runs under Ubuntu/Linux and requires the following software tools to be installed on your system:

* Bowtie2
* Samtools
* Python 3.x (including the Biopython module)
