### Pangenome-based Phylogenomic Analysis

PanPhlAn is a strain-level metagenomic profiling tool for identifying
the gene composition of individual strains in metagenomic samples.
PanPhlAnâ€™s ability for strain-tracking and functional analysis of unknown
pathogens makes it an efficient tool for culture-free microbial population studies.

PanPhlAn is written in Python and covers the 3 main tasks:

* `panphlan_download_pangenome.py`, to download pangenome files (fasta file of contigs, BowTie2 indexes and general information) for over 3,000 species
* `panphlan_map.py`, to profile each metagenomic sample by mapping it against the species of interest
* `panphlan_profile.py`, to merge and process the mapping results in order to get the final gene presence/absence matrix

For custom pangenome generation (advanced) see the [PanPhlAn exporter](https://github.com/SegataLab/PanPhlAn_pangenome_exporter)

---
PanPhlAn runs under Ubuntu/Linux and requires the following software tools to be installed on your system:

* Bowtie2 (bowtie2 >=2.3.0)
* Samtools (samtools >=1.9)
* Python 3 (python >=3.7)

And the following Python libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
